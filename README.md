## About

[nano.wiki](https://nano.wiki) is a community-led wiki project that provides access to information and resources on nano and designed to be objective, useful, and inclusive.

  ## How to Contribute

Contributions are always welcome! There are many ways to get involved.
- #### Content
  
  Content is regularly updated directly from this git repo (about every 5 minutes). Pages are written using markdown and support the full [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/) as well as some [wiki.js](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki) add-ins. View the [full list with examples](https://docs.requarks.io/editors/markdown) here.

  To start creating or editing content, first take a look at existing pages for reference. Each page begins with a table containing meta-data and is then followed by the page contents. To submit your additions, simply submit a pull request.

  Reminder: content should be objective, useful, and inclusive. Where possible, please include your sources in `references.md` and insert in-text citations [1].
  
  Projects and communities have their own respective sections *however*, promoting those which enable illegal or illicit activities, scams, or gambling are strictly forbidden.   

- #### Translations

  [nano.wiki](https://nano.wiki) is currently available in English, but seeks to serve a global nano community. We are always looking to add support for more languages.

  We are looking for translators for: *Italian, Spanish, Arabic, French, German, Greek, Indonesian, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Turkish, Thai, Swedish, Slovenian, Slovak, Russian, Romanian, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Persian, Norwegian, Mongolian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Icelandic, Hungarian, Hebrew, Finnish, Estonian, Dutch, Danish, Czech, Croatian, Chinese (Simplified), Bulgarian, Serbian, and Azerbaijani.*

  These languages have total (or near total) availability natively on wiki.js. Additional support coming soon! 
- #### Donate

  [nano.wiki](https://nano.wiki) relies on community support. The domain alone costs ~$300/year - that's a lot of nano. Any amount helps keep the servers running.
